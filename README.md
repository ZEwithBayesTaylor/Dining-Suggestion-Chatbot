# Dining Suggestion Chatbot

In this Project, I developed a serverless web chatbot with event-driven microservices using AWS S3, API Gateway, Lambda, Simple Queue Service, Amazon Lex, CloudWatch, Simple Email Service.  I also built a recommendation pipeline to suggest restaurants based on user inputs using OpenSearch Service, DynamoDB, and Yelp API.
